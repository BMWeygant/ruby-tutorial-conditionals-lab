# Ruby Conditionals Lab

Uh-oh, Sam is still seeing ghosts! There is easily 27 defenders on the field right now, but rather than call a timeout, he is determined to overcome his fear by facing it head on. Sam has 3 plays he can audible into - a qb sneak, a screen pass, and a rollout Write a conditional statement that helps Sam call an audible, and returns the play result. In this lab, you will place your code inside an empty method called `ghosts_audible` in the file `conditionals.rb`. `ghosts_audible` takes a string as an argument.

This lab will test what you've learned so far about Ruby conditionals. If you need a refresher on conditonals, check out my blog post [here](https://dev.to/bmweygant/common-ruby-operators-and-conditional-logic-25pa).
