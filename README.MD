# Ruby Conditionals Lab
<strong>This guide assumes you have Ruby installed on your machine, a text editor, and a Github account already in place.</strong>

Uh-oh, Sam is still seeing ghosts! There is easily 27 defenders on the field right now, but rather than call a timeout, he is determined to overcome his fear by facing it head on. Sam has 3 plays he can audible into - a qb sneak, a hb screen, and a rollout Write a conditional statement that helps Sam call an audible, and returns the play result. In this lab, you will place your code inside an empty method called `ghosts_audible` in the file `conditionals.rb`. `ghosts_audible` takes a string as an argument.

This lab will test what you've learned so far about Ruby conditionals. If you need a refresher on conditonals, check out my blog post [here](https://dev.to/bmweygant/common-ruby-operators-and-conditional-logic-25pa).

<strong>BONUS POINTS:</strong> 

1. Try to work in string interpolation for one of your conditionals. Hint: it's the one with the play name in it. 
2. See if you can get the same output for "qb sneak" as you do for "QB SNEAK". Go on and investigate a bit!
